# arduino/

This folder contains C++ code for the Arduinos. The "production" code are put in the ardn folders, where n is the DEV\_ID of the Arduino. There's nothing special about any of these Arduinos but we label the hardware for consistency.

The other folders mainly contain test or demo code. Their names should be self-explanatory.
